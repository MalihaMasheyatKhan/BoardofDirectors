After completing graduation in Business Administration (major in Finance) from Independent University of Bangladesh, Ms. Tahmina Afrose Tanna joined their family business of Electrical & Electronics products.<br><br>
                        After joining business, Ms. Tanna planned to do something different for the society as well as for the globe. As a part of her plan, she wanted to change the tradition of washing clothes with peoples own hands. It was a very troublesome process to clean such things. She has significant contribution to develop cost effective, energy saving and eco-friendly Washing Machine, which is considerably easy to wash clothes. <br><br>

Earlier, Bangladesh was only depended on import of Washing Machine and the market place of such item was only Dhaka and Chittagong. The price level of such products was not within the reach of middle class or lower middle class people. Now, it is no more a luxurious item. She played a key role in popularizing the use of Washing Machine in the country through developing the products suitable for our climate and within the purchasing capability of mass people. A washing machine plays an essential role in our home to clean our clothes in a hygienic way and also save our valuable time.  Under the leadership of Ms. Tanna, the local production of Washing Machine blown out and customers are getting high-quality modern technology-based products at affordable competitive prices. She is working for establishing Walton’s strong footing both in domestic and global market.
Ms. Tanna is aware regarding the Global Warming, Climates and Natural Environments. These are changing quicker than wildlife or people can adapt. So many of the world's biggest challenges, from poverty to wildlife extinction are made more difficult by climate change. 
As a part of social responsibility, she has also planned to work with renewable energy. As a first priority of the projects, she has started work on Water Purification Process. <br>
A dreamer in technology-based household appliances, Ms. Tanna has also great interest in games & sports, social awareness program, technical education & cultural activities.
